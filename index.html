The system can be used to manage undergraduates and alumni membership, finances, recruitment, event calendars, and to communicate with the chapter or other chapters seamlessly (and many more features, detailed on the Greek Solutions site).</div>

				<div id='history-title'>Our Philosophy</div>
				<div id='history-content'>
				Purple Lion was the brainchild of many hours spent planning events the hard way. Contacting everyone on our own, tracking everything on our own and doing it all on a very limited, very old online system. We realized after doing all of this that there must be an easier way, and so the beginning foundations of our first custom application was born. After working on this first application, we all realized this could be something more and decided to see where it could take us.
				<br/><br/>

				At PL, we understand we have nothing without you, the user, and so, we value user feedback immensely. Every application is created with certain users in mind and we know it’s important to not lose sight of that. In that same vein, we understand that if an application is easy to use, it makes it that much more enjoyable, creating the best possible user experience.
				<br/><br/>

				We know every organization has different needs. Too often we see organizations try to lump all of their features into one giant system and let everyone use it, whether they all should be or not. More often than not, you end up right back to square one, with a confusing system that has too many options. We don’t want to make an application that works for only half your organization. We want to make the application that fits your company's needs.
				<br/><br/>

				The goal of PL is the creation of simple, scalable solutions that works for your organization, whether it is 10 people or 1000 people. And if you’re not sure yet that PL is the thing for you, then let’s talk about it! We’re happy to discuss any size project and show you how we can craft the perfect solution for you.
